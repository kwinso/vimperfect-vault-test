# Puzzle title

Here goes your puzzle description. Any markdown is allowed in this section.
Anything that comes before the "Hints" heading is interpreted as description.

You can use this section to make a story for your puzzle, explain what exactly users need to do to solve it.

Make sure to avoid giving hints in the description, use the list under the "Hints" heading instead.

## Hints

Use the list below to give hints to the user. If you have multiple hints,
make sure to order then in a logical way. (You can remove this paragraph safely, as it is ignored by vimperfect when your puzzle is merged.)

1. Hint
2. More sophisticated hint, maybe even with a code block
   ```elixir
   IO.puts("I'm a hint!")
   ```

## Initial content

The code fence below is the initial content of the file. You can add a language to
it if you want Vimperfect to highlight code on the site. (You can remove this paragraph safely, as it is ignored by vimperfect when your puzzle is merged.)

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Expected content

This is what you expect the contents of the file to look like after solving the puzzle. If a player manages to transform the initial content to this, they have solved the puzzle. (You can remove this paragraph safely, as it is ignored by vimperfect when your puzzle is merged.)

```python
print("Goodbye, World!")
```
